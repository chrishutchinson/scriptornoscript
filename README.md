# Script or No Script

## What?
A simple guessing game for JavaScript scripts, libraries and frameworks.

Over time I'll add more real and fake items.

## Why?
Inspired by a desire to play around with Angular.js (hint!), and [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/ironshay/status/370525864523743232) from @ironshay.

## What have I learnt?
Basically *everything* is a JavaScript library.
